# Pathtracker

Pathtracker is a simple combat-tracker mainly aimed at Pathfinder 2e,
though it will likely work to some degree for most systems whose combat
order is determined by an initiative score (descending).

Pathtracker aims for simple and fast design with more complex features
being purely optional.
